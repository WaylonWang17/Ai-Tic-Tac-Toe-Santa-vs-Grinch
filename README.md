# Ai-Tic-Tac-Toe-Santa-vs-Grinch

**About**

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented using Python. The player plays as Santa instead of an X and the "Ai" plays as the Grinch instead of O. The GUI is formed from Tkinter, and it decorates the board with Christmas-themed colours as well as a replay button.
